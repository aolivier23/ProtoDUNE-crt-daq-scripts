#allboard.pl is the script that Matt Strait's artdaq process will run to load ProtoDUNE-SP Cosmic Ray Tagger (CRT) 
#configurations, start taking data, and write data as it is taken to a well-defined directory.  Adapted from 
#sevenboard.pl so that I have a starting point that works.  
#
#Usage: 
#allboard.pl <configuration table name>
#
#TODO: Does Matt want this script to just start "the DAQ" and let it keep running?  If so, maybe I could remove the 
#      function that stops data taking and Matt could call it himself.

#TODO: Eventually, Camillo wants to use the sole argument to this script to decide on a "run configuration".  After being corrupted by the 
#      I/O philosophy of gtkmm 3.22, I am tempted to argue for the MySQL table (or database) read here being the sole "configuration mode". 
#      Users would have a well-defined way to interact with and create new configurations (SQL), and it might be easier to keep a consistent 
#      record of configurations used by managing database(s).  Also, separating the configuration format from this script's implementation 
#      removes the temptation to couple configuration more closely to potentially complicated logic encoded in perl.
